        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces dried pasta</li>
            <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese (plus more for serving), grated</li>
            <li>1 ounce Pecorino-Romano cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil pasta in a pot of heavily salted water for about 2 minutes less than the package directions recommend.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, add both cheeses, a generous amount of black pepper, and a splash of cold water; mix vigorously to form a paste.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta, reserving about 2 cups of pasta water.</li>

            <li>Add about 1 cup of pasta water to the skillet; add in the drained pasta and toss. Dollop the cheese paste around in the pan. Mix vigorously to create a smooth sauce, adding in more pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Taste, adjust seasoning as desired, and serve topped with more Parmesan and more black pepper.</li>

        </ol>
