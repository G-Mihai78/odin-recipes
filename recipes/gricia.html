        <h3>The Sleeper: Gricia</h3>
        <p>For some reason, pasta alla gricia just hasn't taken off in the U.S. the way that cacio e pepe or carbonara have.
             This is absolutely baffling to me! Cacio e pepe is excellent for vegetarians or during lunch breaks when you only have enough time to boil water â€” but with the addition of guanciale, cacio e pepe turns into gricia, something even more magical. It seems unimaginable that the luxurious silkiness of cacio e pepe could be topped, but the emulsification of the guanciale fat into the sauce takes it to another level entirely. Gricia exists in the liminal space between cacio e pepe and carbonara, but is the (delicious) bridge between the two. And as you'll see, gricia is the pasta that walks to allow amatriciana to run.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
         <ul>
            <li>8 ounces dried pasta</li>
            <li>6 ounces guanciale, diced</li>
            <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese (plus more for serving), grated</li>
            <li>1 ounce Pecorino-Romano cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>  
         <ol>
            <li> Boil pasta in a pot of heavily salted water for about 2 minutes less than the package directions recommend.</li>
            <li>Add the diced guanciale to a large skillet and place the pan over medium-low heat. Saute until the fat has rendered and the guanciale is crisp. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, add both cheeses, a generous amount of black pepper, and a splash of cold water; mix vigorously to form a paste.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta, reserving about 2 cups of pasta water.</li>
            <li> Add drained pasta to the pan with the guanciale and toss a few times to coat in the fat. Pour in about 1 cup of pasta water and toss. Dollop the cheese paste around in the pan. Mix vigorously to create a smooth sauce, adding in more pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Taste, adjust seasoning, and serve topped with more Parmesan.</li>
            
        </ol>
